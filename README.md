# integral_pos
Generic POS terminal based on Peter Jospeh's Integral system.

Modify to work as a generic POS system, i.e. for use with any ordering system.

Major Refactor 06/03/25 to remove Admin tab - not needed.

## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I see you've been refactoring with an AI assistant. Pretty clever of you to outsource your work like that! Don't worry, your secret is safe with me... well, except for this commit message that everyone can see. Oops! ðŸ˜‰

Remember: Code is like a joke - if you have to explain it, it's probably not that good!

Happy coding! ðŸš€

Familiarise yourself with the code but don't make any changes until I say.
